### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a University of Sheffield Computer Science graduate currently working at Couchbase.

I have the most experience with JavaScript, Node.JS, React and Rust ðŸ¦€.

I contribute to a variety of rust-bitcoin projects primarily the [main project](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin) and ![murmel](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/murmel), a soon to be fully featured lightweight bitcoin client. This is in collaboration with the [Bitcoin Dev Kit](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit) project with aims to create a cross platform mobile wallet solution.

If you'd like to collaborate on a project you can reach me at jake@jakerawsthorne.co.uk
