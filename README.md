### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a University of Sheffield Computer Science graduate currently looking for a frontend, backend or fullstack job.
I have the most experience with JavaScript, Node.JS, React and Rust ðŸ¦€ but I'm confident in my ability to learn new languages quickly so would be willing to adapt to a role in any language. I'm from Manchester but willing to relocate to anywhere in the UK or work remotely.

The project I'm spending most of my time on is a bitcoin full node implementation. The majority of the low level details are implemented in Rust and the web based gui is implemented in React/TypeScript.

If you'd like to discuss job opportunities or just want to collaborate on a project you can reach me at jake@jakerawsthorne.co.uk
